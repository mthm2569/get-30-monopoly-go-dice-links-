Monopoly Go is a reimagined version of the classic board game that's beloved around the world. The free-to-play app for Android and iOS mixes traditional elements of the almost 100 year-old game, like collecting property, building houses, and passing Go, with online multiplayer and mini-games.

To progress through Monopoly Go, you'll need plenty of Dice Rolls, which is a crucial in-game currency. Each time you want to move around the game's virtual board, you'll need to use up a Dice Roll. To get more dice, you'll have to take advantage of daily login bonuses, complete more of the game, and take part in events, among other things.

You can also spend real-life money to get more Dice, but if you'd rather not do that you can just use Monopoly Go Free Dice Links instead. Clicking on these links, which are shared each day on the app's official Instagram account, and sometimes on Facebook, will help you claim Dice Rolls entirely for free!

Monopoly Go Dice Link not working for you?
Have you just tried claiming a Monopoly Go Dice Link and it didn't work? Dice links can only be redeemed once per Monopoly Go account, so if you click on a link and get a message that says "This reward has already been claimed" then that means you've redeemed it previously. If you get a message that says "This reward cannot be claimed" then that means one of two things. This error message appears when a link has expired, or when a link has just been released - and you need to close and re-open your Monopoly Go app to get it working. Keep checking back here, we are constantly updating this page with the latest links, and removing links when they stop working.

If you click on a dice link and it doesn't even open in Monopoly Go then that's a different issue. From our experience, there can sometimes be teething troubles when you try to open a dice link on an Android device. When you click on a link in your browser, you should get a pop-up menu asking you to 'open in another app'.

There are more than 100 Christmas-themed stickers to collect and exchange for rewards.
If this doesn't happen, and the link instead opens up a separate tab on your browser and doesn't redeem, try refreshing that page and see if the pop-up menu appears. You can also try clicking on the link again and see if that triggers the menu. If none of these troubleshooting tips work, try closing and then re-opening the Monopoly Go app so it's running in the background. Then, head back here and try clicking on the link again to see if that kicks things into gear.
